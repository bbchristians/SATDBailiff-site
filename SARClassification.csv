API cleanups.  * Removed node.traverse() deprecations since the new traversal API is only tentative and might change in upcoming releases.  * Replaced org.neo4j.graphdb.traversal.Position with org.neo4j.graphdb.Path since Positions don't do anything Paths already do.  * Added Path.lastRelationship() to support using Paths instead of Positions.  * Removed the tentative node.expand() methods for now  they might be introduced in a later release.  * Removed the Expansion interface that came with node.expand()  * Cleaned up naming around TraversalDescription:    * Renamed TraversalFactory to Traversal  to give the nice pattern of {{{TraversalDescription traversal = Traversal.description()}}}  * Added an iterator() method to Path for iterating over both nodes and relationships (interleaved) (Path extends Iterable<PropertyContainer>)  * Renamed SourceSelector to BranchSelector  since that name better describes the role and purpose of that interface.    * Renamed ExpansionSource to TraversalBranch to match this    * Renamed SourceSelectorFactory to BranchOrderingPolicy to match this and to further clarify the role of an object implementing this interface.,SAR

API cleanups.  * Removed node.traverse() deprecations since the new traversal API is only tentative and might change in upcoming releases.  * Replaced org.neo4j.graphdb.traversal.Position with org.neo4j.graphdb.Path since Positions don't do anything Paths already do.  * Added Path.lastRelationship() to support using Paths instead of Positions.  * Removed the tentative node.expand() methods for now  they might be introduced in a later release.  * Removed the Expansion interface that came with node.expand()  * Cleaned up naming around TraversalDescription:    * Renamed TraversalFactory to Traversal  to give the nice pattern of {{{TraversalDescription traversal = Traversal.description()}}}  * Added an iterator() method to Path for iterating over both nodes and relationships (interleaved) (Path extends Iterable<PropertyContainer>)  * Renamed SourceSelector to BranchSelector  since that name better describes the role and purpose of that interface.    * Renamed ExpansionSource to TraversalBranch to match this    * Renamed SourceSelectorFactory to BranchOrderingPolicy to match this and to further clarify the role of an object implementing this interface.,SAR

XWIKI-8579: Properly handle multilingual documents (translations) in Solr - Set up field aliases to ensure that  at query time  when quering for a multilingual field  all its variations (title_en | title_ro | title_fr | etc...) are queried as well. This is configured in solrconfig.xml. - Added schema.xml configurations (field types and dynamic fields using the field types) for various languages (default supported ones provided by Solr). More configuration of the language resources is needed. - Updated the metadata extractors to use the new field layout. - Attachments/objects/properties are now indexed for all languages  making sure that they are not skipped on searches. Before  they were only indexed for the language of the original document  causing searches in the language of a translations to not hit these entities. - Updated schema.xml and solrconfig.xml files with some of the changes in the Solr default ones  though some cleanup might still be necesary to remove unneeded components.,SAR
