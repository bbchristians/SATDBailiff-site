It will auto-detect classes involved and create jaxb context for it. Works for most cases, if not, user can still provide the context path or object factory. - Improved multi-part support (user can specify part content-type and filename) - Response deserialization is now automatically choosing the deserializer to pick (given ContentType is present in the response). Behavior can be overriden - Http entity writing has been abstracted, 4 implementations are given: UrlEncodedFormEntityWriter, MultiPartEntityWriter, XmlEntityWriter, JsonEntityWriter. Can be customized."

The id is used to identify which piece of state applies in a particular scenario.  This is used to distinguish ""name"" and ""description"" label state. + Refactored some common functionality related to property change listeners from Action to a new class AbstractAction. + Extracted some label parsing utilities (related to mnemonics and accelerators) from Action to LegacyActionTools. + Extracted some common constants into CommonCommandPersistence. + Created SelectionEnablerExpression to wrap the legacy SelectionEnabler framework. + Started work on a proxy for pulldown delegates."

The change was accomplished by factoring out the old BogusFeed logic and creating a stand-alone class in core called SimulatedExchange.  Other changes include moving DateUtils from an interior class to a top-level class (still in core, might one day graduate to utils) and adding unit tests for the event classes.  The event classes themselves were expanded and refactored to support the new types of market data being requested."

This method should never have been in WikiEngine to begin with. ReferenceManager is also completely ""unhooked"" from FilterManager/PageEvent events, and instead listens to (new) ContentEvents that are emitted when JCR events happen. This is much, much cleaner and will allow PageRenamer to be eliminated Real Soon Now (and moved to ContentManager, where it belongs). SearchManager is similarly unhooked from FilterManager and listens for ContentEvents. Among other things, this also means that saved pages won't be indexed twice. 10 failing unit tests remain in ReferenceManager, and a few bugs still need to be pounded out. I will make one more major checkin of ReferenceManager, soon, to fix remaining tests. Overall passrate is now nearly 93%."

It seems more code is dependent on an ordered list of map properties than originally thought.  All of this code was in danger of getting an unexpected ordering of map properties. Refactor PropertyDefinitionMap.getProperties() to return the ordered set of map properties, and provide a new getMap() method to be used as needed. Solidify by making it clear whether the calling code is getting an ordered set of properties or accessing the unordered Map.

This can signficantly reduce the time the plugin takes talking to the accurev server.  - New feature: Get streams singly - more of an accurev client workaround really; the plugin used to call the server and get ""the streams"" which included absolutely everything under the sun, and this turns into many megabytes of data, every poll and every build.  This server setting says to get just the streams we care about (our stream, our parent stream etc), albeit at the cost of potentially making more than one call to the server. Enhancement: Logging improved, which should make debugging accurev client failures a little easier. Enhancement: Now weakly caches the XmlPullParserFactory. Refactor: Extracted out code that runs the accurev client command into its own class, reducing duplicated code and making parsing of command-output more consistent. Refactor: Split out many of AccurevSCM's inner classes into their own files in an attempt to make the main class more maintainable."

We can add timestamp checking for updating records later, but this removes the problems associated with relying on filesystem timestamps and a single tracking timestamp. Included in this fix is some refactoring to reduce memory usage, including a hack to flush the project cache periodically. This hack can be removed when the project cache is configurable (see MRM-142). This now indexes the ibiblio repository from scratch in ~23 minutes, and incremental indexing takes 30-60 seconds."

The idea is that each proxy is associated to a status that includes a locking object (that is a bare java.lang.Object) on which the proxy can be locked on. The proxy storage drives and leads the locking/unlocking mechanism. Moreover, the proxy storage now uses the proxy status in order to keep synchronized all the proxy's structures. A status wraps the proxy, the lock, some statistical data (e.g., how many manipulation the proxy has done). Finally, the proxy storage no more uses the proxy id, but the proxy directly, from which it can infer the ID (that is supposed to be fixed among manipulations)."

I know the netty project wraps and uses spaces, but I don't like it! This can easily be changed back when being pushed to netty anyway. I've consolidated a few classes and tried to make things more consistent in general. I've removed a couple interfaces which were primarily there to make mocking easier - I may add them back later... Fixed some bugs with channels not being correctly closed/marked as closed. Whichever end closes the connection should now result in both ends being correctly handled. This still requires some testing to confirm what happens when the link itself is severed, opposed to 1 end being cleanly shut down."

Represents work in progress and later revisions might be undo some of this invasiveness. This is a very large commit so read on for more detail - PaymentInfo has been renamed to OrderPayment - PaymentInfoDetail has been renamed to PaymentTransaction - Payment workflows have completely gone away and thus the application of payments to an order has been decoupled from invoking checkout - Better javadocs across all of the payment domain (although by no means are complete) - Deprecate/remove any baked-in dependency on anything that implements Referenced. Use of entities implementing this interface should be treated as an edge-case rather than the common case - Move the Referenced entity into their own packages

In its new version the element expiry mechanism has now to be   explicitly defined. If ehcache 3 provides a default mechanism for TTL-based   expiry or TTI-based expiry, nothing is provided to define a mechanism based   upon both TTL and TTI as it was in ehcache 2. So a custom expiry mechanism   is defined to implement close the way the TTL-and-TTI-based expiry was   managed in ehcache 2.   With the new version of ehcache, any null key throws immediately   NullPointerException. This cause problems with MessageManager that uses the   application cache and particularely in tests. So, the tests were updated to   initialize MessageManager and a check is performed in MessageManager when   accessing the application cache to catch the NullPointerException exception."

This avoids making BaseConnection expose these and AbstractJdbc2Connection just proxy these to the real type information handing.  Additionally now type information can be setup differently for each JDBC version which will be required for things like SQLXML support because the JDBC2 code can't use the java.sql.Types values for JDBC4.

Ideally, the parameter contains a valid ISO8601 pattern like the example in structr.conf_templ. When using such a pattern, all date strings output by Structr are fully ISO8601 compliant. On the input/parsing side, Structr supports four different flavours of ISO8601-like formats, making date parsing more fault-tolerant."

REFACTORINGS: - refactoring: OpCreateImpl, OpDeleteImpl - better naming of entry and account related variables. - cleanup of NativeAttribute (unused methods / fields) - refactoring UpdateNISUserCommand: sudoStart should be before the try/finally block. If something goes wrong in sudoStart, the program should stop immediately, and should not try to do sudoReset (that lies in the finally block). - united calls of getOwner script across all the NIS operations (AbstractNISOp#initGetOwner() is the central hub for all). - both Create/UpdateNISGroupCommand use the same logic for processing some output, so created a common method for them: AbstractNISOp#parseNisOutputForErrors(String outputFromCommand). - better naming in UpdateNISUserCommand.java, OpDeleteImpl.java, OpCreateImpl.java - erased unnecessary code from NativeAttribute. - doc update on SolarisConnection (needs review from Andrei TBD)"

The package com.silverpeas.notification is now renamed to com.silverpeas.usernotification as the classes that are in this package defines an API for user notification. Refactor both the management of the component instance ids and of the space ids in the Admin side: previously, the id of these objects were converted between their business form (named as the client id in Admin) and their local/technical form (named as driver id in Admin). This conversion occurring directly on the id of these object, it impacts negatively the client codes as some times clients code work on driver ids whereas others (the main client codes) work on the business id and, as they cannot know the form of the id they get, a lot of conversion codes occurred (and occurres yet again) in the clients sidegit status! The refactor defines now two methods to ComponentInst and SpaceInst/SpaceInstLight: getId() returns the business id whereas getLocalId()/setLocalId() in about the technical id (driver id). With this change, Admin, SpaceInstManager, ComponentInstManager, ... and clients codes are deeply updated as consequently. As the impact on the functionalities are important here, a deep test phase will be required to check all is ok. The refactoring were just on the Admin side; it will be required later to plan a refactoring of the client codes that work stupidly on the technical ids instead of the business ids."

This allows the use of CAstNode.LOOP forms for such loops. 5) Some bug fixes to the mechanisms of the CAstRewriter to handle weird control flow cases. 6) An example of retranslation to specialize JavaScript methods based on how many arguments they receive at call sites."

Changed it so that the fetching of the auth token and building of the subscribe message is now done by the PrivateChannelImpl and PresenceChannelImpl classes themselves, and only when they actually need to subscribe. They will also call the authorizer every time they need to subscribe, which should make resubscription after a connection loss work properly. Also added EndToEndTest.java which mocks out very little (just the websocket) so is useful for making API calls to Pusher and seeing which messages come out the other end."

Add GlobalComponentRegistryService for use by services that need to ensure an Infinispan cache container's channel is started.

(1) FLVReader now uses a prefetching buffer for file reading and the file won't be mapped to memory at the beginning but read as needed. The prefetching buffer is mainly used for reducing the disk IO overhead and the size of buffer can be configured in red5-common.xml as a static property of FLVReader ""bufferSize"". (2) Cache for FLVReader in FLV is temporarily disabled by returning null on FLVReader.getFileData(). We need to redesign the cache architecture to put cache logic beneath FLVReader so that both tag caching and file caching are feasible."

60550e1c885b67a50a4f6ee0921ff52beb3afcce,"* XWIKI-411 (Define checkstyle rules and define an associated build strategy). Improved checkstyle rules. * Applied defined checkstyle rules on the Zip Explorer plugin, leading to some refactoring, including removing all Vector references (replaced by List). Hopefully this shouldn't affect existing scripts. * Fixed bug in Zip Explorere plugin found by Checkstyle (checkstyle forced me to refactor the downloadAttachment method because there were too many return statements. Thus I've created a isValidZipURL() method and thus I've added a unit test for it showing the bug). The bug was that ""http://server/xwiki/bin/download/Main/Document"" was considered a valid ZIP URL... Note: There's no JIRA issue for the creation of the Zip Explorer plugin and thus I couldn't refer it from this comment."

Pure homoplasmic variants (pool AF = 1 or 0) would have heteroplasmy=1. b) Don't output pool genotypes by default for large pool sizes because it makes file sizes explode and they're unreadable. c) Refactored classes ExactACCounts and ExactACSet and moved to superclass AlleleFrequencyCalculationModel because both Pool and Exact AF calculation models will use it. d) Initial refactorings and skeleton for linearized multi-allelic exact model (not done yet). e) Unit test for Pool AF calculation model."

This can happen when the quartz job   runs at the same time as a runtime plugin update that removes types.

A new class is defined to gather all the properties specific to a an object in the timeline of a calendar: CalendarComponent. CalendarEvent and CalendarEventOccurrence encapsulate now an instance of CalendarComponent as the main part of their properties are now provided by an instance of CalendarComponent. CalendarComponent is a technical class that defines all the properties an object planned in a calendar must have. Its name comes from the ical specification. To prepare a change into the management of the occurrences of a recurrent event so that it matches the way they are managed in the ical specification, CalendarEventOccurrence is now an entity that can be persisted with the changes operated at the occurrence level (it diverges then from the recurrence rule of the event it comes from). For instance, the management of the occurrences of a recurrent event is kept as it is up to now; the work on the occurrence lifecycle management will be another commit"

Refactorings: * Got rid of ComponentSuiteResolver, because the ComponentSuiteRegistry has to be filled in advance, anyway, and this is what the IDEA plugin now also does. Simplified ComponentSuiteRegistry accordingly. * Split XmlToJsonHandler used for all EXML parsing into two handlers, one for the metadata (ExmlToMetadataHandler) and one for the Ext-component-JSON (ExmlToJsonHandler). The metadata is needed to (re)build the XSD, the JSON is needed when generating the AS3 class. Opened API to generate a single class. * Removed some too exhaustive logging and a few souts."

For doing, the interface of the indexers have changed: they don't depend anymore on the MainSessionController and on the ComponentContext classes, but they depend only on the ComponentInst instance concerned by the asked indexation. Indeed, ComponentInst class gathers all the information that can be required by the indexation: the component instance concerned by the indexation, the space to which the component instance belongs, and so one. Some indexations rely also on the current user asking the indexation; this information can be fetched from the UserDetail class itself (it delegates the call to the cache management above the current user session). By refactoring the indexation API by this way, the indexer can now either delegate the indexation process to a business service (for example KmeliaBm for the Kmelia application or NodeService when the nodes are concerned, ...) or perform itself the indexation by using explicitly the methods of the business service."

Note that even if all configurations have been refactored to support the CamelCase, the case remains insensitive when it's read.  * Added TableConfig and ColumnConfig: placeholder for all possible configurations  * Refactored ColumnConfiguration and TableConfiguration to use ConfigToken instead of plenty of fields/accessors  * Improved exception handling when a wrong configuration group was activated  * Refactored export mechanism to be able to use a totally custom export. Some export formats use reserved words, such as ""csv"", ""pdf"", ""xml"", ""xls"" and ""xlsx"" and allow to activate default values (e.g. mimeType, built-in export classes)  * Refactored all Thymeleaf processor with the new configuration mechanism. Also eased all method signatures thanks to the abstract superclasses.  * Updated all unit tests  * Removed the cdn option from the TLD and from the Thymeleaf dialect: it now handled by Dandelion Core  * Closed dandelion/issues#141 by making some classes implementing the Serializable interface  * Closes dandelion/issues#191  * Closes dandelion/issues#176"

Because the entities can be an aggregate of data persisted into different data sources (database, JCR, filesystem, ...), it is expected the repository to take into account of these by using the corresponding data managers. The JPA EntityManager is one of these managers for the persistence in databases. The EntityRepository implementation for JPA is just a manager for JPA with additional stuffs for Silverpeas. If the entities are just managed by JPA, then the repository has just to extend the SilverpeasJpaEntityManager."

Added static method to generate an absolute URL to avoid    creating new instances when not needed. - Updated WSRPProducerImpl.isRemotable method to use the proper constant."

Created ""SecantSolverTest"", moving there all the tests for the class ""SecantSolver"" that were located in class ""BrentSolverTest"". Created new interface and base class for polynomial functions solvers (""LaguerreSolver"") so that the function type is now checked at compile time. Removed deprecated exceptions (MATH-441). Javadoc clean-up. Lowered tolerance values in some unit tests. Tests upgraded to Junit 4 (MATH-423)."

As it turns out, naive matching based on looping over all child non-terminals in a children table from the Trie, is just too expensive for reasonable size grammars. In fact the best would be split the Trie in two parts: one for children that are non-terminals and one for children that are terminals. This would be the most general solution. This is an expensive solution only in that is requires a thorough refactoring of the rule table code."

Server-side, if the request is served by a ClusteredRPCContainer container, then this integer is campared with the integer resulting from the locations attached to the ClusteredRPCContainer container. If these integers differ, then the CRPCC locations are attached to the JNDI or EJB responses. Locations propagated back to the EJB client override the EJB client locations definition. * Support new substitution group element openejb-clustering-wadi which has been added to geronimo-openejb-2.0.xsd schema."

This will allow ParallelizableJobs to create and work with files at any time, rather than waiting until writeJobResults is called (good for jobs that would otherwise need to allocate a lot of memory to store internal state). - All ParallelizableJob methods modified to throw Exception (the class handling the job should deal with exceptions, not the job itself). - Added wrapper class JobExecutionWrapper to wrap exceptions thrown by a job in a JobExecutionException. - Modified JobServer and ParallelizableJobRunner to handle JobExecutionExceptions (the former will log the exception and cancel the job cleanly and the latter will throw a RuntimeException). - Modified existing ParallelizableJobs to conform to new interface."

The dispatch SPI is insufficient to support views of resources as dispatchers are isolated from each other and are not aware of the HTTP methods supported on a resource. Further more the removal of the Views annotation requires dynamic view detection at runtime when runtime generated 4xx responses occur. This should trigger a lookup of a view, and if present should perform synchronized update of the resource class state with that view information. (Unfortunately it is not possible to scan all files in the classpath and detect views at configuration time. One advantage of the dynamic approach is views can be added at runtime.)"

Notable changes: - Public interface to RMDTrackBuilder is greatly simplified; users can use it only to build    RMDTracks and lookup codecs. - RODDataSource and RMDTrack are no longer functionally at the same level; RODDataSources now   manage RMDTracks on behalf of the GATK, and the only direct consumers of the RMDTrack class   are the walkers that feel the need to access the ROD system directly.  (We need to stamp out   this access pattern. A few minor warts were introduced as part of this process, labeled with TODOs.  These'll be fixed as part of the VCF streaming project."

cec3f03fcc6a94185f27f3b7727e7dc15fd88f87,Fixes #897 - Refactor the Site non-persistent extension manager This has now been moved to an extension manager on the service as trying to utilize BroadleafRequestContext does not always work. In some cases Site resolution happens prior to running the BroadleafRequestContext. Moving this to the service (where the non-persistent logic happens anyway) guarantees proper execution of adding more properties onto the non-session-managed instance.

Provide auto hide invisible console in subtask container. Now when SelectType and SelectData page is active, the original preview canvas is invisible and hide automatically, so internal preview canvas can be shown. 4.       Replace class name ChartWizard with WizardBase in code as much as possible. In fact, some static methods, such as ChartWizard.displayException, still can use ChartWizard class. Even if you don?t use it, the static class can be invoked. 5.       Move some interfaces and classes from ui.extension to ui plugin. Ideally, UI extension plugin is not supposed to use or extend by other plugins. 6.       Use generic Collection in code."

The local one is like it operated previously.  The global one lives in /humgen/gsa-hpprojects/GATK/data/integrationtests.  If the system can find this directory then MD5s will also be read / written to this location.  This means that gsabamboo will print differences as appropriate.  And all users will in effect have access to a complete history of MD5 file results. A few minor code reshuffles changed VariantRecalibration and VCFHeader test files.

This allows a user to select a non-native way to read input in case they are running on a platform that doesn't support the native library (jline's native lib or sigar's native lib) or in case the native library has a bug and is causing the agent to crash. If you use ""sigar"", and you disable the native system API (native --disable), this will cause the console to fallback to the ""java"" console impl. If user is using ""jline"", there is no fallback to - if jline is giving problems, you must exit the agent, and specify a --console argument to override the console to use. The default is ""jline""."

e264159f01d78cb43c7e348fec5a27c1ff645bde,A lot of general code cleanup and refactoring. Made Part properties in tables dropdowns. Made Package properties in tables dropdowns. Added a new Identifiable interface which most model items will eventually implement. This makes it easier to use them in lists. Changed upload-snapshot to check for unlicensed files before upload. Part now throws a RuntimeException if you try to set it's ID to null. I think setting is going to go away completely after a GUI review. Added the basic framework for adding new packages. This is somewhat dependant on the above ID decision and is not yet complete. Now that I think of it… I am probably getting closer to a database / primary key idea here. Got rid of the auto complete dropdowns for now. They look like hell and barely work. Added concrete list models for a few of the config lists. Upgraded to swingx 6.1.4. mvn eclipse:eclipse will now download and install javadocs and sources for dependencies. Changed build number to 5 characters only.

If need be, the transport can be decoupledif we need the flexibility. For now, we only have one implementation of a connection and don't need the decoupling. * Reorganized code into more appropriate packages.   * Using com.heroku.api.http http related information (e.g. headers). This is not intended for transport -- use connection, or some other package, for transports.   * Using com.heroku.api.exception for any custom exceptions.   * Using com.heroku.api.util for utilities * Made CommandConfig immutable * Added a static method in HttpUtil for encoding name=value parameters in HTTP requests. It's currently used in Command implementations. * Added HttpHeader, which should be used by Command implementations for providing header information."

JNDI is now the preferred method of obtaining mail sessions, and will always be attempted first before falling back to the stand-alone method. See the JavaDocs for MailUtil. All of MailUtil's internal code, test properties and JavaDocs were also totally refactored. A sample JNDI block for JavaMail was added to web.xml; it is commented out by default."

The behaviour is now such that, when we get a ZK disconnection, we shut down as master, but any currently running task is not interrupted. Such a running task might possibly wait in a ZkUtil.retryOperation-loop for the connection to come back up. This is useful as it reduces the chance of work being done none-atomically. Also, if we took a lock on ZK to modify an index, the lock might otherwise not be released, leaving the index locked forever in case the connection does come back (even though the release happens in a finally block, ZK will not send out a request if the thread is already in interrupted state, according to my empirical tests).

Migrated over the BaseLiquibaseTask to use the new types and ported over the old attributes to maintain backward compatibility.

I performed the same migration of old attributes to the new types. Still have to finish refactoring the diff tasks and generate change log tasks. A lot of additional documentation and deprecation marking was completed and logging was added to notify users of deprecated attributes to migrate over to the new model.

More doc/info to follow shortly. Issues still to be solved: a) Walker changes all genotypes based on Beagle data, but annotations on the original VCF are unchanged. They should in theory be recomputed based on new genotypes. b) Current implementation is ugly, dirty unwieldy and will necessitate a refactoring soon so I can keep my pride. Most aesthetically affronting issue right now is that we read the full Beagle files at initialization and keep them in memory, but a more delicate implementation would just read from files on a marker by marker basis. Issue that currently prevents this is that BufferedReader() instances don't seem to play nice when called from the map() function."

Also refactored HAGDb (in MasterServer) to fail early if unable to bind its communication port.

The ID is initialized to be the report's index (starting at 0) in the KSC configuration file and is persisted the first time changes are saved to the file during normal editing. - Instead of having a set of fields in the KSC_PerformanceReportFactory that track what report and graph are being editing, move this to the new KscReportEditor object along with related methods and store this object in the user's session. - Use Asserts in afterPropertiesSet and other methods to simplify things. - Format code in a few places. - Refactor some controller handleRequestInternal() methods."

ShellJobRunner refactored to use direct ProcessController and now kills jobs on shutdown. Better QGraph responsiveness on shutdown by using Object.wait() instead of Thread.sleep().

fe60b2bbf6a048d286a8d098a3c3b537a28249ab,XWIKI-4772: Improve typing speed * Changed the DeferredUpdater to use a timer instead of deferred commands. As a consequence the number of updates while the user is typing has decrease. * Introduced a cache mechanism to be used while the editor is updating its state (e.g. the tool bar). * Cached some of the Executable#isEnabled and Executable#isExecuted implementations that are used by multiple classes. As consequence the number of evaluations done on editor state update has decrease. * Changed RichTextArea#getDocument() implementation to avoid useless checks since this is one of the most called methods. * Refactored Executable interface to not depend on the rich text area. As a consequence concrete executables can have access to the rich text area from the start and thus can better cache its state.

ff598cc102e6ccd7750405a0a0bbc2e6632b8d1f,"First checkin of new content-inspection package, designed to refactor SpamFilter functions into a series of stacked Inspector classes that can analyze and score content in multiple ways, including for spam detection. See the package.html and Javadocs for detailed descriptions on the API design. These features will be used by ANY and ALL ActionBeans to allow for spam filtering via the @SpamProtect annotation and SpamProtect JSP tag. Three notable limitations of this checkin: 1) no CAPTCHA integration yet; 2) Comment.jsp is temporarily broken; 3) User registration not hooked into content inspection just yet. All will be addressed soon."
