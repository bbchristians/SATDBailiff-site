000d011444d9bd24028e59b23e2e20842c9da876,"* In alignment-to-text, tsv or tsv-single-base output there was a column for score but no header. added header. * For the QueueObjectPool, made a more generic interface and added a Null version that always creates new objects. This can be used for performance comparisons. * Added another layer of object abstraction GobySamRecord which contains one or more GobySamSegment. Things that exist for the entire read are stored in this object and the parser returns a GobySamRecord instead of a List<GobySamSegment>. This is easier to understand and models the data better. * Discovered a minor error with GobySamSegment sequence variation generation * Added tests from seq-var to verify seqvar during clipping, indels, etc. Make sure gsnap->sam->GobySamParser gets the same output as gsnap->compact-alignment->display-sequence-variations which enabled me to find one more issue with gsnap->compact-alignment seqvar generation related to soft clipping."

As far as I can tell right now, only two jobs remain unfinished: * JOO-5: At least managed to complement ""this."" for private members and for public members declared in the same file. * JOO-30: Implemented ""as"" and function syntax type cast in the runtime for interfaces only (and with bad performance, as the cast() call is completely obsolete). Also worked on support for get and set functions: these are only supported syntactically, and so far converted to normal functions named get$<member> and set$<member>. Not yet decided on a real solution."

This mapping is done so that the nightly testing process can control which datasources are being used and can ensure retestability."

Updated all usages of the single arg constructor with a null value, to prevent compilation errors. 2. Added a mechanism to abstract out instrument specific functionality into pluggable classes. All the instrument functions in this checkin are abstracted out except for XML serialization, which requires the specific Instrument classes to be included in an annotation. 3. Added new option position APIs & option symbol <=> option root lookup APIs to the client. 4. Added pluggable mechanism to extract & insert instrument from / into FIX messages 5. Updated PositionKeyComparator to use new pluggable mechanism for position comparison 6. Updated orderloader to support options 7. Removed OptionSymbolSplitterMessageModifier & its unit test as it doesn't make sense for options any more. 8. Updated ORS to save the fields for options for position computation. Added implementations for the new client services. 9. Updated FIXConverter and RequestHandler to add a particular FIX field to the message only if it is supported for the specific message. 10. Added OptionRootUnderlyingMap abstraction to the ORS for carrying out option symbol to option root symbol mapping. 11.

Both live in performance and are always shown on the choose   resource page there.  The response time resource type is now used to   get data for the ResponseTimeModel (and is the only resource type there).   Eventually the ResponseTimeModel will go away, and along with it the need   to differentiate based on ""type"" (e.g.: performance or response). - Added a GraphDao for fetching prefabricated and adhoc graph definitions   including an implementation for the current properties file format.   Supporting objects are PrefabGraphType and AdhocGraphType (for the two   major groups of performance and response graphs) and PrefabGraph (which   is now a boring old model object).  The code for the properties   implementation was pulled out of GraphModelAbstract and RRDGraphServlet. - The RRDGraphServlet now requires a resourceType to be passed and the   root directory for RRD files is now based on the resourceType, not the   type. - Use Spring to create and wire up the GraphDao, ResponseTimeModel, and   PerformanceModel objects.  None of the servlets or JSP pages are currently   wired up directly by Spring, so they get these beans from the   WebApplicationContext. - Switch the performance adhoc graph JSPs over to be fully resourceType   aware.  They can now generate adhoc graphs for any resource type. - *LOTS* of supporting changes and cleanup. "

30fae5cf18e4e34cc05e45d4832ef74d86e70682,"Major redo of exact AF computation for UnifiedGenotyperV2. Fact of life is, there's no way we can compute an exact QUAL field and keep performing the AF computation in linear probability space. In good sites with lots of samples, the ratio of Pr(AC=K*|D) to Pr(AC=0|D) can be 10^1500 or some ridiculous large number like that, which no double can represent. So, we abandon probablity space and work now in log likelihood space, which has several major repercussions: a) Sites were numerically well behaved now, but another hard fact of life is that the AF iteration is defined in linear Pr space, not in log likelihood space, and the math doesn't work out in log space. So, we need to convert back and forth from lin to log space. b) As a consequence of a), the code got a major slowdown, and calling the 629 samples was about 15 times slower than before (sic). c) To solve b), log10 of integers are now cached at init, and numerical approximations are now made. Most importantly, I'm using the approximation that log(exp(a) + exp(b)) ~= max(a,b) which seems almost inconsequential in practical performance but reduces computation time to what it was before. More detailes analyses are forthcoming. This approximation can be refined further on to avoid expensive log-exp conversions if further profiling and analysis deems it necessary."

It does add a little robustness to JMSConnectionSunMQ, but the major contribution is a simplification, that makes it feasible to try a reconnect on failing sends - this should be addressed in a review, though. The commit also contains a rollback of a faulty update of JMXUtils to do a backup in seconds, on a value that was computed in milliseconds. This made it impossible to wait less than 1000 seconds on JMX timeouts.  There is also a little unit test cleanup."

3d22c9e8ac70c843c2ba5f8f151cee1e173151f7,"Rework of the blobstore functionality where blobs can only be accessed through the record they are used in and not directly by using their blob key. The general idea is that, to enable introducing record-level access control in the future, blobs should only be accessed through the record they are used in (via the repository API) and not directly using their blob key. Only in the very initial phase, where blobs are uploaded to the blobstore, can they exist without being part of a record. Before a blob can be used in a record it must have been uploaded to the blobstore. During a certain amount of time (e.g. 1 hour) the uploaded blob can then be used in a record. If after that time the blob was not used in a record it will become unavailable and will be removed from the blobstore. Blobs can be re-used, but only within different versions (also non-sequential ones) of the same field of the same record. Blobs cannot belong to multiple records or multiple fields at the same time."

Also, finally, found the possible loophole in which it was possible that no device profile was set in the device configuration. This was due to the code reading the device metadata twice, which is redundant. Either the device type is selected in the UI, or by the 'show device metadata' button. After that, it is the 'truth' wrt the remainder of the code."

Supporting objects are PrefabGraphType and AdhocGraphType (for the two   major groups of performance and response graphs) and PrefabGraph (which   is now a boring old model object).  The code for the properties   implementation was pulled out of GraphModelAbstract and RRDGraphServlet. - The RRDGraphServlet now requires a resourceType to be passed and the   root directory for RRD files is now based on the resourceType, not the   type. - Use Spring to create and wire up the GraphDao, ResponseTimeModel, and   PerformanceModel objects.  None of the servlets or JSP pages are currently   wired up directly by Spring, so they get these beans from the   WebApplicationContext. - Switch the performance adhoc graph JSPs over to be fully resourceType   aware.

556480deb0cc29d2073984d5db7a7c29d67ca4b2,"Bug 58901.  Massive overhaul of the commands API to fall in line with some API commentary.  Most of the changes are related to javadoc only, but there have been two significant concepts removed from the API.  IContextBinding and IImageBinding have been removed for the 3.0 release.  They will probably reappear shortly thereafter.  They provide functionality that is not needed for 3.0, and only serve to clutter the new API.  I'd prefer to keep as clean and simple for the major release and then start working on completing commands in the 3.1 timeframe."

Specifically, now: a) VCF track name can work again with 3.3 or 4.0 VCF's when specifying -B name,VCF,file. Code will read header and parse automatically the version.  b) Old VCF codec is deprecated. Reader goes now direct from parsing VCF lines into producing VariantContext objects, with no intermediate VCF records. If anyone can't resist the urge to still input files using the old method, a new VCF3Codec is in place with the old code, but it will be eventually deleted. c) VCF headers and VCF info fields no longer keep track of the version. They are parsed into an internal representation and will be output only in VCF4.0 format. d) As a consequence, the existing GATK bug where files are produced with VCF4 body but VCF3.3 headers is solved. e) Several VCF 4.0 writer bugs are now solved. f) Integration test MD5's are changed, mostly because of corrected VCF4.0 headers and because validation data mostly uses now VCF4.0. g) Several VCF files in the ValidationData/ directory have been converted to VCF 4.0 format. I kept the old versions, and the new versions have a .vcf4 extension."

[changed] Sprite to derive from TextureRegion. Slightly cleaner because TextureRegion#flip modifies the Sprite position. [changed] Sprite to update the TextureRegion u,v,u2,v2 fields. This isn't that big of a deal, and allows SpriteBatch and other internal classes to avoid the getters without unexpected results. [changed] TextureAtlas.AtlasSprite to only handle the position offset due to whitespace stripping. This includes flip. Scaling a Sprite that has whitespace removed will not scale the offset.

Use java.home in public/VectorPairHMM/pom.xml to pass environment variable JRE_HOME to the make process. This is needed because the Makefile needs to compile JNI code with the flag -I<JRE_HOME>/../include (among others). Assuming that the Maven build process uses a JDK (and not just a JRE), the variable java.home points to the JRE inside maven. 3. Dropped all pretense at cross-platform compatibility. Removed Mac profile from pom.xml for VectorPairHMM"

The second field is for information purposes, and it is this second uneditable field that actually contributes the field back into the fix message. * Anywhere there was a method like isPut(), I replaced it with getPutOrCall() which returns PutOrCall.PUT or PutOrCall.CALL.  This allows for fewer ""if (isPut()) ... else"" constructs. * The application now assumes that internally, messages use the PutOrCall field, and the MaturityMonthYear (rather than MaturityDate) regardless of FIX version.  These are then modified on the way to the OMS if necessary. * I found that the OptionOrderTicketControllerHelper was getting a little ungainly, so I factored out all of the logic surrounding the ""details"" of the option series into the OptionSeriesManager.  That is all of the logic around updating the combos and such is in there.  Everything else is still in the OptionOrderTicketControllerHelper."

756c2f44ad6393f83bca80b6282c5a6d228ab024,"Added a HashIntSet class that uses hashing with linear probing to get most of the memory benefits of ArrayIntSet and better performance than a HashSet<Integer> (presumably because of less boxing and better spatial locality).  The downside is that you need to pick a sentinel value that can't be stored in the set, but that's not a problem in any application for which I've ever used an IntSet.  In some (admittedly simplistic) Google Caliper testing, HashIntSet was 22% faster than ArrayIntSet and 73% faster than HashSet for arrays of size N=10, 100% faster than ArrayIntSet and 69% faster than HashSet for N=100, and 357% faster than ArrayIntSet and 74% faster than HashSet for N=1000."

Note that even if all configurations have been refactored to support the CamelCase, the case remains insensitive when it's read.  * Added TableConfig and ColumnConfig: placeholder for all possible configurations  * Refactored ColumnConfiguration and TableConfiguration to use ConfigToken instead of plenty of fields/accessors  * Improved exception handling when a wrong configuration group was activated  * Refactored export mechanism to be able to use a totally custom export. Some export formats use reserved words, such as ""csv"", ""pdf"", ""xml"", ""xls"" and ""xlsx"" and allow to activate default values (e.g. mimeType, built-in export classes)  * Refactored all Thymeleaf processor with the new configuration mechanism. Also eased all method signatures thanks to the abstract superclasses.  * Updated all unit tests  * Removed the cdn option from the TLD and from the Thymeleaf dialect: it now handled by Dandelion Core  * Closed dandelion/issues#141 by making some classes implementing the Serializable interface  * Closes dandelion/issues#191  * Closes dandelion/issues#176"

9c42dd6cd90db09412ce505409261c309f6ae897,"Fixing incorrect use of RowLocker in IndexUpdater: the return value should be checked to know if the lock has been obtained.  * introduced a blocking RowLocker method which retries until the lock can be obtained (with some maximum timeout)  * IndexUpdater skips pushing the message if the lock cannot be obtained within one minute.  * introduced RowLockerMetrics to keep track of the frequency of lock contentions (= failures to take a lock because the row is already locked)  * use a common RowLocker instance in the lily-server (in order to have a single corresponding metrics instance). For the Kauri-wiring this required the introduction of a RowLocker interface. Meanwhile noticed that the lock-contentions (due to indexupdater taking a lock to push a message) are not really a rare thing (at least when running the tester & mbox tools), i.e. not only in the indexupdater but also in the client apps, likely leading to performance degration due to operations that need to be retried."

In a long run, I believe doing this control in the queue with ResourceController is better, because (1) scheduling one at a time can create unnecessary wait time --- say if one of the configuration needs to run on a slave that's blocked, then it's better to schedule others first, and (2) the notion of shared resources spans beyond a single job, so doing that coordination at a job level isn't general enough. That said, I think it'll be easy enough to maintain data compatibility when this happens, so I'm committing this change now."

The ID is initialized to be the report's index (starting at 0) in the KSC configuration file and is persisted the first time changes are saved to the file during normal editing. - Instead of having a set of fields in the KSC_PerformanceReportFactory that track what report and graph are being editing, move this to the new KscReportEditor object along with related methods and store this object in the user's session. - Use Asserts in afterPropertiesSet and other methods to simplify things. - Format code in a few places. - Refactor some controller handleRequestInternal() methods."

This property is now set in the profile, but we need to better define the Update Compatibility use case to determine the right way to get the filter set. Currently a vm arg (system property) -Dorg.eclipse.p2.update.compatibility=true  is used to  feature installation by setting the value of the ""eclipse.p2.install.features"" property in a new profile to be the value of the system property."

Prior to changes it took between 30 and    40 minutes to execute a MDSCHEMA_MEMBERS with CUBE_NAME and    LEVEL_UNIQUE_NAME restrictions against that dimension. After these    changes it takes 25 seconds. The reason for the previous large runtimes    times are:    1) XMLA restriction filtering was done at the end of generating    Row objects. This lead to large number of objects being created only    to be discarded. For the small dataset, it used 900mb of heap and    then started GC madly. The checkin pushed the filtering as high up the    evaluation as could be done.    2) In an earlier checkin I had replace the ArrayList Row implementation    with a HashMap implementation - this was a mistake on my part.    3) The setting of Member ordinals for the small dataset was 651865ms    and with this checkin is now 4241ms. The difference is how all    of the members are loaded and how they are traversed.    For FoodMart things are also faster.    Tests were run with the CmdRunner; who knows if an XMLA client    can even consume the close to 2 million line SOAP XML response    generated for the MDSCHEMA_MEMBERS request.    Added printing FreeMemory at debug level to XmlaHandler and    to RolapResult."

Submits identical queries to the   system at the same time; for repeatability of tests. - Can specify `groupings' of query weights in config file. A shorthand to   make config management a little easier.

Migrated over the BaseLiquibaseTask to use the new types and ported over the old attributes to maintain backward compatibility. Added two new abstract classes that extend from BaseLiquibaseTask that will encapsulate the common functionality from change log tasks and diff tasks. I performed the same migration of old attributes to the new types. Still have to finish refactoring the diff tasks and generate change log tasks. A lot of additional documentation and deprecation marking was completed and logging was added to notify users of deprecated attributes to migrate over to the new model.

Firstly, for the label that is matched to in the function 'produceMatchingChildTNodesNonterminalLevel' if this function returns true, only strict matching is allowed. Secondly, in the function matchAllEqualOrBothNonTerminalAndNotGoalOrOOV, the function is applied that non-exact matching is only allowed for non-terminals that are not OOV or GOAL symbols."

f71066d5d32523ac45cf4600b03282594b5cbfc9,"- Fix for bug#2216 -- KSC Report list is reordered every time a new report is added. - A unique ID is assigned to each KSC report, is persisted across edits, and is used instead of the report's index in the KSC configuration file everywhere, particularly in URLs.  The ID is initialized to be the report's index (starting at 0) in the KSC configuration file and is persisted the first time changes are saved to the file during normal editing. - Instead of having a set of fields in the KSC_PerformanceReportFactory that track what report and graph are being editing, move this to the new KscReportEditor object along with related methods and store this object in the user's session. - Use Asserts in afterPropertiesSet and other methods to simplify things. - Format code in a few places. - Refactor some controller handleRequestInternal() methods."

Hense, when the cursor cache is exhausted, resuming from the store is just fine. Without the sync, moving from cache to store can result in duplicate messages, out of order messages and on occasion missing messages. disabling the cache resolved all of the above but kills performance. Syncing the sore add and cursor add is the correct solution, but it has an impact on concurrent transaction completion for a destination, paralell completion across destinations can still continue, so there is still some batching potential"
