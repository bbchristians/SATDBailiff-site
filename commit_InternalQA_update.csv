000d011444d9bd24028e59b23e2e20842c9da876,"* In alignment-to-text, tsv or tsv-single-base output there was a column for score but no header. added header. * For the QueueObjectPool, made a more generic interface and added a Null version that always creates new objects. This can be used for performance comparisons. * Added another layer of object abstraction GobySamRecord which contains one or more GobySamSegment. Things that exist for the entire read are stored in this object and the parser returns a GobySamRecord instead of a List<GobySamSegment>. This is easier to understand and models the data better. * Discovered a minor error with GobySamSegment sequence variation generation * Added tests from seq-var to verify seqvar during clipping, indels, etc. Make sure gsnap->sam->GobySamParser gets the same output as gsnap->compact-alignment->display-sequence-variations which enabled me to find one more issue with gsnap->compact-alignment seqvar generation related to soft clipping."

Updated all usages of the single arg constructor with a null value, to prevent compilation errors. 2. Added a mechanism to abstract out instrument specific functionality into pluggable classes. All the instrument functions in this checkin are abstracted out except for XML serialization, which requires the specific Instrument classes to be included in an annotation. 3. Added new option position APIs & option symbol <=> option root lookup APIs to the client. 4. Added pluggable mechanism to extract & insert instrument from / into FIX messages 5. Updated PositionKeyComparator to use new pluggable mechanism for position comparison 6. Updated orderloader to support options 7. Removed OptionSymbolSplitterMessageModifier & its unit test as it doesn't make sense for options any more. 8. Updated ORS to save the fields for options for position computation. Added implementations for the new client services. 9. Updated FIXConverter and RequestHandler to add a particular FIX field to the message only if it is supported for the specific message. 10. Added OptionRootUnderlyingMap abstraction to the ORS for carrying out option symbol to option root symbol mapping. 11.

3b22e76889f75dcf91455e4c2fcd4c657551142a,"Two features useful for ancient DNA processing. Ancient DNA sequencing data is in many ways different from modern data, and methods to analyze it need to be adapted accordingly. Feature 1: Read adaptor trimming. Ancient DNA libraries typically have very short inserts (in the order of 50 bp), so typical Illumina libraries sequenced in, say, 100bp HiSeq will have a large adaptor component being read after the insert. If this adaptor is not removed, data will not be aligneable. There are third party tools that remove adaptor and potentially merge read pairs, but are cumbersome to use and require precise knowledge of the library construction and adaptor sequence. -- New walker ReadAdaptorTrimmer walks through paired end data, computes pair overlap and trims auto-detected adaptor sequence. -- Unit tests added for trimming operation. -- Utility walker (may be retired later) DetailedReadLengthDistribution computes insert size or read length distribution stratified by read group and mapping status and outputs a GATKReport with data. -- Renamed MaxReadLengthFilter to ReadLengthFilter and added ability to specify minimum read length as a filter (may be useful if, as a consequence of adaptor trimming, we're left with a lot of very short reads which will map poorly and will just clutter output BAMs)."

3f43ea8faa4ae7d26ba88d743241487c2eab2bcf,Refactored the HA test classes:  * Test cases are now better isolated. Failure in one case should not affect others.  * All tests that execute code in multiple processes now use the SubProcess abstraction.    * This provides better tracability for (failing) test cases by giving access to stdout/stderr of all subprocesses.    * Each line of output is identified by the name of the testcase and the pid of the subprocesses.  * Removed most Thread.sleep() calls from the test code.  * Added a log4j.xml file in the test resources to get tracability of failures in ZooKeeper. Also refactored HAGDb (in MasterServer) to fail early if unable to bind its communication port.

Jackson mix-ins are used for all IO specifications. Details for log4j-api: - Log4jMarker is public so it can be accessed Jackson XML and JSON IO code. Details for log4j-core: - The POM now depends on the JSON and XML databindings. Note that the runtime only needs Jackson if the JSON or XML layout or listeners are used. - The class StackTracePackageElement has been renamed ExtendedStackTraceElement and tracks the StackTraceElement it conceptually extends. StackTraceElement is a final JRE class so we use composition. This allows (de)serialization to deal with the extended stack trace in a more OO and simple manner. - The ThrowableProxy has been reworked to (de)serialize easly. It now tracks the suppressed exceptions of its Throwable. - The XML and JSON layouts also use the same Jackson XML/JSON IO specifications. Both sides of the IO are in sync!  - There are unit tests of course. - org.apache.logging.log4j.core.LogEventListener.log(LogEvent) is now public.

Ancient DNA sequencing data is in many ways different from modern data, and methods to analyze it need to be adapted accordingly. Feature 1: Read adaptor trimming. Ancient DNA libraries typically have very short inserts (in the order of 50 bp), so typical Illumina libraries sequenced in, say, 100bp HiSeq will have a large adaptor component being read after the insert. If this adaptor is not removed, data will not be aligneable. There are third party tools that remove adaptor and potentially merge read pairs, but are cumbersome to use and require precise knowledge of the library construction and adaptor sequence. -- New walker ReadAdaptorTrimmer walks through paired end data, computes pair overlap and trims auto-detected adaptor sequence. -- Unit tests added for trimming operation. -- Utility walker (may be retired later) DetailedReadLengthDistribution computes insert size or read length distribution stratified by read group and mapping status and outputs a GATKReport with data. -- Renamed MaxReadLengthFilter to ReadLengthFilter and added ability to specify minimum read length as a filter (may be useful if, as a consequence of adaptor trimming, we're left with a lot of very short reads which will map poorly and will just clutter output BAMs)."

If that's the case and if we're within a slighly higher threshold we just return and get on with our business and let the one doing the purge do that and count on it getting down the cache to a decent size. If the cache size grows above the higher threshold we will sit and wait for the current purge to complete to not flood the cache.

So we don't need complexity arising from all functionalities being in one place. SchemaLocking now owns locks and locking implementaion has been moved to procedure2 package. - Removed NamespaceQueue because it wasn't being used as Queue (add,peek,poll,etc functions threw UnsupportedOperationException). It's was only used for locks on namespaces. Now that locks have been moved out of Queue class, it's not needed anymore. - Remoed RegionEvent which was there only for locking on regions. Tables/namespaces used locking from Queue class and regions couldn't (there are no separate proc queue at region level), hence the redundance. Now that locking is separate, we can use the same for regions too. - Removed QueueInterface class. No declarations, except one implementaion, which makes the point of having an interface moot. - Removed QueueImpl, which was the only concrete implementation of abstract Queue class. Moved functions to Queue class itself to avoid unnecessary level in inheritance hierarchy. - Removed ProcedureEventQueue class which was just a wrapper around ArrayDeque class. But we now have ProcedureWaitQueue as 'Type class'. - Encapsulated table priority related stuff in a single class. - Removed some unused functions.

c604ed9440babc16d67668f4b30d6f933a7b48d1,"Several improvements to new indel genotyper (more to come soon): a) Turns out previous change of centering haplotype around indel was a bad idea. Context to the left of indel is important but not as important as right one, because by definition all alleles start at the same location, so haplotype is the same to the left of indel regardless of allele. So, go back to having a constant size window to the left of event. b) Expand reference context so we can test larger haplotypes. c) Optimize computation of read likelihoods by doing them in linear array instead of in a matrix - no difference in biallelic sites but could be significantly faster in multiallelic sites. d) Bug fix: read alignment wasn't being computed correctly if, a) we were at an insertion, b) read started right at the insertion, c) read CIGAR didn't include insertion - more of these corner conditions are lurking, so a revamped computation of how reads align to candidate haplotypes is in the works. e) Add debug option not to use prior haplotype likelihoods. f) Don't hard-code NA12878 for genotyping, now sample name is a required input argument. g) Bug fix: if there are no reads covering a candidate indel event, just output NO_CALL (didn't notice this in HiSeq, but in P1 data it happens all the time). I need to add a confidence threshold for calling later on."

Honestly most of the pom.xml file is just magic to me. I understand parts , but like most things in java I have no idea how its doing most of what its doing. Its a large cryptic XML document with very little human readable meaning. I mean Makefiles were considered arcaic, however you can find a dozen or so simple introductions on how to construct a Makefile that doesn't depend on magic to build your project. Not so with Maven. The only official Documentation is a 100+ line document that has no coorliation to what is actually happening to build your file. Take for example the fact that i know have a whole target folder that has lots of stuff in it. At no place in my pom.xml did I say create a target folder, nor did I say run javac. The closest I came to either of those was set my ""source"" tag to 1.5 ( I only knew to do this because Bukkit does it ). Furthermore the comand to compile the project into a jar ( again no mention of a jar file in the pom.xml ) is to issue a mvn install command. That clearly makes sense. mvn build anyone mvn package, nope mvn install. Its like java heads have a fetish for complexity."

The size of the pool is based on direct.agent.pool.size. The existing direct agent pool will run all commands other than cron and ping. 2. For normal tasks (generated as part of user/admin API calls), if throttle limit is reached then tasks get queued up for subsequent execution once threads are available. 3. For cron and ping tasks (internally generated by MS like ping, VM sync etc.), if throttle limit is reached then these gets rejected. Since these are internally generated these can be rejected without any issues."
